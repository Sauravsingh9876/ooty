  <hr>

  <p>Ooty is officially known as <strong> Udhagamandalam</strong> (also known as <strong> Ootacamund </strong>(listen (help·info)); abbreviated as Udhagai), is a city and a municipality in the <em> Nilgiris </em> of the South Indian state of <strong> Tamil Nadu</strong>. It is located 86 km (53 mi) north west of Coimbatore and 128 km (80 mi) south of Mysore and is the headquarters of the Nilgiris district. It is a popular hill station located in the Nilgiri Hills. It is popularly called the Queen of Hill Stations. It was the summer capital of the Madras Presidency.</p>
<h2>HISTORY OF OOTY</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company at the end of the 18th century. The economy is based on tourism and agriculture, along with the manufacture of medicines and photographic film. The town is connected by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway. Its natural environment attracts tourists and it is a popular summer destination.[4] In 2011, the town had a population of 88,430.[2] Ootacamund was rated the best hill station in means of hospitality and nature passing other hill stations like Munnar and Kodaikanal.</p>

<h2>WHO IS TODA PEOPLE? </h2>
<br>
<p>Toda people are a Dravidian ethnic group who live in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu. Before the 18th century and British colonisation, the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including the Kota, Badaga and Kurumba, in a loose caste-like society, in which the Toda were the top ranking. During the 20th century, the Toda population has hovered in the range 700 to 900. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted "a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy" and "their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs".[3] The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology.</p>

  <li><h3>avalanche lake</h3>
  <p>Surrounded by mountains and covered by lovely flowers, Avalanche Lake Ooty is a famous tourist spot in the Nilgiris district, away from the bustling traffic. Avalanche Lake Ooty makes the perfect setting for a family and adventure package.

    If you are wondering how the lake landed with such a name, it is a misnomer because it was formed by a huge landslide and not an avalanche. You find large varieties of flowers, like magnolias and rhododendrons blooming on all sides of the lake. The waterfalls rushing down the nearby mountains further add to the beauty of this already alluring landscape.
